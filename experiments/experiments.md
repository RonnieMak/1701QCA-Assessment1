## Instructions ##

*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment name ###

Using an LDR and analog inputs.

Photo shown the sucessful experiment of lighten up the LED with light sensor within a complece circuit. 

#### Reflection ####

This is one of the very first experiments with the micro bit, it teaches me how to complete an electric circuit with wire, resistant and LED light, and how to control the compont using the code. This is a critical technique for the feature project using the micro bit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as the red light green light for the pedestrian crossing; the icon will change if the user pressed the button in this experiment it used the light sensor to change the icon. Which means it can do the same thing if we just change the code. 

### Experiment name ###

Using a transistor to drive a motor.
